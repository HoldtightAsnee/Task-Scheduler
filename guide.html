            <h2 class="heading">Creating a schedule</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Select the 'Start Day'. This is the first day of the schedule.</li>
                <li>Select the 'End Day'. This is the last day of the schedule. The days between the start day<br> 
                    and the end day will be populated by the scheduler. To create a schedule for a single day,<br>
                    set the end day to be the same as the start day.
                </li>
                <li>Set the 'Start Time'. This is the time you would like your schedule to begin.</li>
                <li>Set the 'End Time'. This is the time you would like your schedule to end.</li>
                <li>Set the 'Duration of Each Task'. This should be a time between the 'Start Time' and 'End Time'.<br>
                    The scheduler will populate a suitable number of tasks with this duration.
                </li>
            </ul>
